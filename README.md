# SelectorTest Process Module

This module creates a page in the ProcessWire admin where you can test and build
selectors without editing a template file or a bootstrapped script.

## Features

* Edit selector string and run it to see matching pages
* See errors as they're reported by ProcessWire directly at the page
* Add pagination
